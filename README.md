# 💼 Job Portal

A terminal-based **Job Portal System** developed in **Java** as part of a university project at **International Islamic University, Islamabad**. This system allows job seekers and employers to interact efficiently through a menu-driven interface, with role-based functionalities and modular design using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Java** – Core language for backend logic and terminal interface.
* **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** – For modular, maintainable, and scalable code.
* **Java Collections (Lists)** – Efficient data management for jobs, users, and applications.

---

## ✨ Features

* ✅ **Role-Based Functionality**:

  * **Employers** can post, update, and delete job listings.
  * **Job Seekers** can view jobs, apply, and receive notifications.

* ✅ **Menu-Driven Terminal Interface** – Simple, interactive navigation for both employers and job seekers.

* ✅ **Matching Engine** – Matches job seekers with relevant job postings based on skills and experience.

* ✅ **Notification System** – Alerts users about job applications and updates.

* ✅ **Modular Architecture** – Follows **Facade Pattern** to simplify interaction between components.
